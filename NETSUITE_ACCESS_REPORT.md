# 📊 NetSuite Access Analysis Report - GYM + Coffee
**Account ID:** 7326096_SB1 (Sandbox)  
**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Authentication:** Token-Based Authentication (TBA) with OAuth 1.0  

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary

Your NetSuite TBA connection is **working** but with **limited access**. You can query master data (customers, vendors, items, locations) but **cannot access transactional data** which is critical for most business operations.

### Key Findings:
- ✅ **12 tables accessible** via SuiteQL (out of 100+ tested)
- ❌ **NO access to transactions** (sales orders, invoices, etc.)
- ❌ **NO access to analytics tables**
- ✅ **JOIN operations work** between accessible tables
- ✅ **Custom fields visible** on standard records

---

## ✅ What's Currently Working

### Accessible Tables via SuiteQL:

| Table | Record Count | Fields | Description |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **customer** | 839 | 53 | Customer master data including custom fields |
| **vendor** | 1,073 | 25 | Vendor/supplier information |
| **item** | 15,142 | 50 | Products, services, and other items |
| **location** | 53 | 17 | Stores, warehouses, offices |
| **subsidiary** | 4 | 31 | Company subsidiaries |
| **department** | 17 | 7 | Organizational departments |
| **classification** | 37 | 7 | Business classifications |
| **account** | 367 | 17 | Chart of accounts |
| **currency** | 7 | 13 | Currency configurations |
| **consolidatedexchangerate** | 497 | 10 | Exchange rate data |
| **unitstype** | 1 | 3 | Units of measure |
| **recentrecord** | 0 | - | Recently accessed records |

### Working Query Capabilities:
- ✅ Basic SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- ✅ JOIN operations between tables
- ✅ Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- ✅ GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- ✅ CASE statements
- ✅ String functions (UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH)
- ✅ Date filtering and comparisons
- ✅ LIKE operator with wildcards
- ✅ Custom field access (custentity_*, custrecord_*)

### Sample Working Queries:

```sql
-- Customer analysis with subsidiary
SELECT 
    c.id,
    c.companyname,
    c.email,
    s.name as subsidiary_name,
    s.country
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN subsidiary s ON c.subsidiary = s.id
WHERE c.email IS NOT NULL

-- Item summary by type
SELECT 
    itemtype,
    COUNT(*) as item_count,
    AVG(cost) as avg_cost
FROM item
GROUP BY itemtype

-- Custom fields on customers
SELECT 
    id,
    companyname,
    custentity_2663_customer_refund,
    custentity_2663_direct_debit
FROM customer
WHERE companyname LIKE '%Coffee%'
```

## ❌ What's NOT Working

### Critical Missing Access:

#### 1. **Transaction Tables** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- ❌ `transaction` - Master transaction table
- ❌ `transactionline` - Line item details
- ❌ `salesorder` - Sales orders
- ❌ `invoice` - Customer invoices
- ❌ `purchaseorder` - Purchase orders
- ❌ `cashsale` - Cash sales
- ❌ `vendorbill` - Vendor bills
- ❌ All other transaction types

**Impact:** Cannot retrieve any sales, purchase, or financial transaction data

#### 2. **Analytics Tables**
- ❌ `transactionanalyticsbyuser`
- ❌ `itemanalyticsbyperiod`
- ❌ `customeranalyticsbyperiod`
- ❌ All analytics views

**Impact:** No access to pre-aggregated analytics data

#### 3. **Employee & HR Data**
- ❌ `employee` - Employee records
- ❌ `timesheet` - Time tracking
- ❌ `payroll` - Payroll data

**Impact:** Cannot access workforce data

#### 4. **System & Audit Tables**
- ❌ `systemnote` - Audit trail
- ❌ `loginaudit` - Login history
- ❌ `savedsearch` - Saved searches

**Impact:** No audit trail or saved search access

## 🔐 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Transaction Access is Blocked:

1. **Missing Permissions:**
   - The integration role lacks "Transactions > View" permission
   - Missing "Reports > SuiteAnalytics Workbook" permission
   - No "SuiteAnalytics Connect" feature enabled

2. **Sandbox Limitations:**
   - Some sandbox environments have restricted transaction access
   - Analytics tables may require production environment

3. **Role Configuration:**
   - Token was created with a limited role
   - Web Services permission alone is insufficient

---

## 📋 Action Plan to Gain Full Access

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Contact NetSuite Admin)

#### 1. **Request Permission Updates**
Ask your NetSuite administrator to update the integration role with these permissions:

```
✅ Required Permissions:
□ Transactions > Sales > View
□ Transactions > Purchases > View
□ Transactions > Bank > View
□ Reports > SuiteAnalytics Workbook
□ Reports > SuiteAnalytics Connect
□ Lists > Employees > View (if needed)
□ Custom Records > View All
```

#### 2. **Enable Features**
Request enabling these NetSuite features:
```
□ SuiteAnalytics Connect
□ SuiteCloud > Token-Based Authentication
□ SuiteCloud > REST Web Services
```

#### 3. **Create New Integration & Tokens**
After permissions are updated:
1. Create new integration record with broader scope
2. Generate new tokens with enhanced role
3. Test with new credentials

### 🔄 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES (If Permissions Can't Be Changed)

#### Option 1: **Use REST API for Specific Records**
```python
# Some records may be accessible via REST even if SuiteQL fails
GET /services/rest/record/v1/salesOrder
GET /services/rest/record/v1/invoice
```

#### Option 2: **Create Custom RESTlets**
- Build custom endpoints in NetSuite
- Can bypass some permission restrictions
- Requires SuiteScript development

#### Option 3: **Use Saved Searches**
- Create saved searches in NetSuite UI
- Access via SuiteTalk SOAP API
- Works around SuiteQL limitations

#### Option 4: **Request Read-Only Transaction Role**
- Create specific read-only role for transactions
- Less risky for NetSuite admins to approve
- Sufficient for reporting/analytics

## 📊 Data You CAN Extract Now

Despite limitations, you can still extract valuable data:

### 1. **Customer Analytics**
```sql
-- Customer distribution by subsidiary
SELECT 
    s.name as subsidiary,
    COUNT(c.id) as customer_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN c.email IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_email
FROM customer c
JOIN subsidiary s ON c.subsidiary = s.id
GROUP BY s.name

-- New customers by period
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM datecreated) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM datecreated) as month,
    COUNT(*) as new_customers
FROM customer
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM datecreated), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM datecreated)
```

### 2. **Inventory Analysis**
```sql
-- Item catalog summary
SELECT 
    itemtype,
    COUNT(*) as items,
    SUM(CASE WHEN isinactive = 'F' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as active_items
FROM item
GROUP BY itemtype

-- Price list analysis
SELECT 
    id,
    itemid,
    displayname,
    baseprice
FROM item
WHERE baseprice > 0
ORDER BY baseprice DESC
```

### 3. **Master Data Relationships**
```sql
-- Location-subsidiary mapping
SELECT 
    l.name as location,
    l.fullname,
    s.name as subsidiary
FROM location l
LEFT JOIN subsidiary s ON l.subsidiary = s.id
```

## 📈 Recommendations

### For Business Intelligence:
1. **Focus on master data analytics** until transaction access is granted
2. **Export customer/item data** for external analysis
3. **Build a data pipeline** to sync master data regularly

### For Integration Development:
1. **Start with customer/item sync** as proof of concept
2. **Prepare transaction integration** code for when access is granted
3. **Document all data requirements** for NetSuite admin

### Priority Actions:
1. **HIGH:** Get transaction table access (critical for business operations)
2. **MEDIUM:** Enable analytics tables for reporting
3. **LOW:** Add employee/HR access if needed
