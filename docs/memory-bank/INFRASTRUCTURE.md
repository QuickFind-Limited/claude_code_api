# Infrastructure

## Deployment Architecture

- Containerized microservices on Kubernetes
- Multi-tier architecture (API, cache, storage)
- Load balancer with ingress controller
- Service mesh for internal communication
- External dependencies via managed services

## Container Strategy

- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Python 3.13 alpine base images
- Non-root container execution
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Image vulnerability scanning
- Registry with signed images

## Orchestration

- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- Helm charts for configuration management
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
- Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB)
- Resource quotas and limits
- Rolling deployment strategy

## CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated testing on PR
- Docker image build and push
- Kubernetes deployment automation
- Environment promotion gates
- Rollback capabilities

## Environment Management

- Development: Local Docker Compose
- Staging: Single-node Kubernetes
- Production: Multi-node cluster
- Environment-specific secrets
- Configuration via ConfigMaps
- Blue-green deployment support

## Monitoring & Logging

- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Structured JSON logging
- Log aggregation with Fluentd
- Distributed tracing
- Health check endpoints

## Security Infrastructure

- Network policies isolation
- RBAC access controls
- Pod security standards
- Secrets management with Vault
- TLS termination at ingress
- Container image scanning

## Backup & Recovery

- Database automated backups
- Configuration backup to Git
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Point-in-time recovery
- Cross-region replication
- Recovery time objectives (RTO)

## Scaling Strategy

- CPU and memory-based HPA
- Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)
- Cluster autoscaling
- Redis cluster for cache scaling
- Connection pooling
- Circuit breaker patterns

## Network Architecture

- Private cluster networking
- Ingress controller with SSL
- Service discovery via DNS
- Network segmentation
- External service endpoints
- CDN for static assets
