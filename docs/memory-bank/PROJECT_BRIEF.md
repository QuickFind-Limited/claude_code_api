# PROJECT_BRIEF.md

## Vision
Enable seamless Claude Code integration through a high-performance Python SDK server

## Mission
Provide a robust, developer-friendly SDK server that abstracts Claude Code complexity for external applications

## Problem Statement
- Applications need programmatic access to Claude Code capabilities
- Direct Claude Code integration is complex and resource-intensive
- No standardized interface for Claude Code operations
- Developers spend time on integration instead of core features

## Solution
Python 3.13 SDK server offering RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections for Claude Code interactions

## Key Features
- RESTful API endpoints for all Claude Code operations
- WebSocket support for real-time interactions
- Authentication and authorization system
- Request/response validation and error handling
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Auto-generated API documentation

## Target Users
- Application developers integrating Claude Code
- DevOps teams building automation workflows
- Third-party service providers
- Enterprise clients requiring programmatic access

## Success Factors
- Sub-100ms response times for standard operations
- 99.9% uptime reliability
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Clear documentation and examples
- Backward compatibility guarantee
- Active community adoption

## Value Proposition
- Reduces integration time from weeks to hours
- Eliminates Claude Code complexity overhead
- Provides enterprise-grade reliability and security
- Enables rapid prototyping and development
- Supports multiple programming languages through HTTP

## Business Goals
- Accelerate Claude Code ecosystem adoption
- Generate revenue through premium features
- Build developer community and partnerships
- Establish market leadership in AI SDK servers

## Technical Goals
- Achieve horizontal scalability to 10k+ concurrent users
- Maintain memory efficiency (<500MB base footprint)
- Support async/await patterns throughout
- Implement comprehensive error recovery
- Ensure type safety with full mypy compliance
- Enable containerized deployment patterns
